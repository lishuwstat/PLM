There are 6 .R files:

1. gen_data.R: the code used to generate data (one covariate with non-linear effect).

2. Support Functions.R: necessary functions used to implement the proposed method (one covariate with non-linear effect).

3. Simulation.R: the main simulation code of the proposed method (one covariate with non-linear effect).

4. gen_data2.R: the code used to generate data (two covariates with non-linear effects).

5. Support Functions2.R: necessary functions used to implement the proposed method (two covariates with non-linear effects).

6. Simulation2.R: the main simulation code of the proposed method (two covariates with non-linear effects).
